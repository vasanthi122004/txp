TensorFlow
most commonly used machine learning libraries in python
designed by google brain
speacialized in creating neural networks
its power lies in its ability to join together many different processing units

keras
it is an application programming interface
it makes use of tensorflow functions
it streamlines the implementation of tensorflow function, making building in a neural network much easier ansd simpler

encoding
also refers to as word representation
it is a process of converting text data into a form that a machile learning model can understand
primary methods of encoding are one-hot encoding and embedded vectors

recurrent neural network
the data has to be in a fixed size
at any given layer in neural network the data being passed in is simply the output of the previous layer in the network,which r then transfered by the weight of that layer
they can take the previous part of a seentence into accout to interpret context

long short term memory
lstm networks are a specific type of recurrent neural network
while rnns can usualy remember previous words in a sentence,their ability to preserve the context of earlier input degrades over time
lstms are more robust when handeling long strings of text

encoding revisited
one hot encoding refers to the method of representing the text as a series of ones and zeros
a vector is created for every word in the feature set
they r useful when u hve to create a bag of words,
bag of words model are used because they maintain a lot of important information 
the drawback is that they cannot represent the meaninful word, nor they can easily represent the similarities between words

word embedding
it refers to representing words or phrases as a vector of real number
it can use more numbers than simply ones and zeros
the representation can store important info about words
it has fewer dimensions than one hot encoded vectors do
it can generalize because semantically similar words have similar vectors
